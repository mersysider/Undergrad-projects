Prior to LabVIEW 7, some special installations were required to use the XY
table under Windows XP.  The reason was that XP made control of some
parallel port pins difficult.

LabView 7 now has that built in, so no special installation is required.

However, one does have to be careful about which registers are in use.
LPT1 cannot be trusted to be at any particular register address, although
the standard options still seem to hold.  So check the register assignment
via tha device manager.
